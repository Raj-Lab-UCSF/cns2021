                Recently, it has been proposed that the harmonic patterns emerging from the brain's structural connectivity underlie the resting state 
                networks of the human brain. These harmonic patterns, termed connectome harmonics, are estimated as the Laplace eigenfunctions of the 
                combined gray and white matters connectivity matrices and yield a connectome-specific extension of the well-known Fourier basis. 
                However, it remains unclear how topological properties of the combined connectomes constrain the precise shape of the connectome 
                harmonics and their relationships to the resting state networks. Here, we systematically study how alterations of the local and 
                long-range connectivity matrices affect the spatial patterns of connectome harmonics. Specifically, the proportion of local gray matter 
                homogeneous connectivity versus long-range white-matter heterogeneous connectivity is varied by means of weight-based matrix thresholding, 
                distance-based matrix trimming, and several types of matrix randomizations. We demonstrate that the proportion of local gray matter 
                connections plays a crucial role for the emergence of wide-spread, functionally meaningful, and originally published connectome harmonic 
                patterns. This finding is robust for several different cortical surface templates, mesh resolutions, or widths of the local diffusion kernel. 
                Finally, using the connectome harmonic framework, we also provide a proof-of-concept for how targeted structural changes such as the atrophy 
                of inter-hemispheric callosal fibers and gray matter alterations may predict functional deficits associated with neurodegenerative conditions.

                Tracking fast changes in macroscopic network activity is still a challenge in EEG because of low SNR and the effects of volume conduction. 
                We took a multimodal approach to this problem and combined source-reconstructed EEG with the structural connectome. We obtained 
                "building blocks" from the connectome using basic tools from graph signal processing, and then analyzed EEG activity in terms of these 
                building blocks. We found that this approach provides a sparse basis for the EEG signal which is statistically powerful and highly interpretable. 
                I will also take the opportunity to discuss new directions towards which our results may point.

                State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unprecedented opportunities to study brain structure (anatomy) and 
                function (physiology). Based on such data, graph representations can be built where nodes are associated to brain regions and edge 
                weights to strengths of structural or functional connections. In particular, structural graphs capture major neural pathways in white matter, 
                while functional graphs map out statistical interdependencies between pairs of regional activity traces. Network analysis of these 
                graphs has revealed emergent system-level properties of brain structure or function, such as efficiency of communication and modular organization.
                
                In this talk, graph signal processing (GSP) will be presented as a novel framework to integrate brain structure, contained in the structural 
                graph, with brain function, characterized by activity traces that can be considered as time-dependent graph signals. Such a perspective 
                allows to define novel meaningful graph-filtering operations of brain activity that take into account smoothness of signals on the 
                anatomical backbone. This allows to define a new measure of “coupling” between structure and function based on how activity is expressed 
                on structural graph harmonics. To provide statistical inference, we also extend the well-known Fourier phase randomization method to 
                generate surrogate data to the graph setting. This new measure reveals a behaviorally relevant spatial gradient, where sensory regions 
                tend to be more coupled with structure, and high-level cognitive ones less so. Finally, recent work will highlight how the spatial resolution 
                of this type of analyses can be increased to the voxel level, representing a few hundredth thousands of nodes.

                Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes fluctuations that occur over time in functional brain networks. 
                Existing methods to extract dynamic RSFCs include sliding-window and clustering methods with various limitations due to its inherent 
                non-adaptive nature and high-dimensionality including an inability to reconstruct brain signals, insufficiency of data for reliable estimation, 
                insensitivity to rapid changes in dynamics, and a lack of generalizability across multi-modal functional imaging datasets. To overcome 
                these deficiencies, we develop a novel and unifying time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) framework for examining dynamic resting state 
                functional connectivity. TVDN includes a generative model that de- scribes the relation between low-dimensional dynamic RSFC and the brain 
                signals, and an inference algorithm that automatically and adaptively learns to detect dynamic state transitions in data and a low-dimensional 
                manifold of dynamic RSFC. TVDN is generalizable to handle multimodal functional neuroimaging data (fMRI and MEG/EEG). The resulting estimated 
                low-dimensional dynamic RSFCs manifold directly link to the brain signal frequencies, and we can evaluate TVDN performance by examining whether 
                learnt features can reconstruct observed brain signals. We conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate TVDN under hypothetical settings. 
                We then demonstrate the application of TVDN with real fMRI and MEG data and compare the results with the existing benchmarks. 
                Results demonstrate that TVDN is able to detect brain state switching more robustly both in resting state fMRI and MEG data.

                At the inception of human brain mapping, two principles of functional anatomy underwrote most conceptions—and analyses—of 
                distributed brain responses: namely, functional segregation and integration. There are currently two main approaches to 
                characterizing functional integration. The first is a mechanistic modeling of connectomics in terms of directed effective 
                connectivity that mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second phenomenological approach 
                usually characterizes undirected functional connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain networks, 
                self-organized criticality, dynamical instability, and so on. This paper describes a treatment of effective connectivity that 
                speaks to the emergence of intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion of Markov blankets 
                that play a fundamental role in the self-organization of far from equilibrium systems. Using the apparatus of the renormalization 
                group, we show that much of the phenomenology found in network neuroscience is an emergent property of a particular partition of 
                neuronal states, over progressively coarser scales. As such, it offers a way of linking dynamics on directed graphs to the 
                phenomenology of intrinsic brain networks.

                Brain activity, as observed by large-scale recording techniques, is characterized by a rich dynamical repertoire. 
                Either in resting state or while performing a task, the patterns of activity and synchrony between different areas 
                are constantly shifting. This allows the brain to dynamically adjust itself to different environmental demands, 
                explore new configurations, and accordingly shift the balance between segregation and integration of information processing. 
                The structural and dynamical factors that allow this dynamical richness are subject of active research with the use of 
                computational models, which bring together the empirical connectivity obtained from DTI resonance in humans (or others), 
                and the biophysically-inspired dynamics of brain areas. Using this approach, we have been dissecting the structural motifs 
                of the human connectome that best permit the existence of multistable dynamics and the modulation of the integration/segregation 
                balance by neuromodulatory systems. 
                
                We have shown that the large-scale structural connectivity found in the brain, has a unique core-shell organization that
                maximizes a graded activation of areas, which is not achieved by random surrogate connectomes. Consequently, the brain is 
                allowed to show more intermediate (less integrated) activated configurations. When the transitions between integrated and 
                segregated states is promoted by neuromodulators, our simulations suggest that the best targets to promote a global transition 
                are the nodes belonging to the rich club, or the nodes with the highest connection weights. Interestingly, these two subsets 
                overlap only partially. Our results deliver interesting facts about how the structural motifs and features, at the local and 
                global scales, can enable and promote a richer dynamical repertoire for the brain function.

                Neural activity coordinated across different scales from neuronal circuits to large-scale brain networks gives rise to 
                complex cognitive functions. Bridging the gap between micro- and macro-scale processes, we present a novel framework based 
                on the Maximum Entropy model to infer a resting state structural connectome, which represents functional interactions constrained 
                by structural connectivity. We demonstrate that the structurally informed network outperforms the unconstrained model in simulating 
                brain dynamics and traditional measures of functional connectivity. Further, we evaluate magnetization, susceptibility and by extension 
                criticality to probe connectome-level excitation-inhibition balance in cognitively intact middle-aged apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers 
                and noncarriers. Criticality differences in female carriers suggest a global shift to a more disordered state. In sum, this new multimodal 
                network allows for analysis of brain dynamics beyond the confines of traditional or unimodal methods, providing insight into the complex 
                interactions underpinning neural function such as the balance of excitation and inhibition.
